**[Polyfill supply chain attack embeds malware in JavaScript CDN assets](https://snyk.io/blog/polyfill-supply-chain-attack-js-cdn-assets/)**Â â€” What started as a polyfill JavaScript library sell-off in which maintainer Andrew Betts transferred GitHub repository rights to a third-party company ended up as a malware distribution vehicle for a Chinese malicious actor, now putting in danger as much as 4% of the web.Â <sub>[snyk]</sub>

<hr/>

In other news, a tutorial on the devto website wants to teach developers about building Node.js servers and completely fails to provide security disclaimers or follow secure coding practices. Surely, there are other issues at play but I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt they wanted to teach the basics. Hopefully you can find the security issues here:
