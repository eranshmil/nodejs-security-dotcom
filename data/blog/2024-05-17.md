Command injection vulnerabilities are a severe security threat in Node.js applications. They arise when user-controlled input is used to construct system commands, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on your server.

Here, we explore secure coding practices to prevent such vulnerabilities and analyze real-world examples (CVE-2024-21488, CVE-2019-25158 as a couple of recent examples and reference points) to understand the risks and mitigation strategies.

## 1. Prefer Secure Command APIs

`child_process.execFile`: This function executes a specific binary file, providing a safer alternative to `child_process.exec` as it avoids shell interpretation of arguments.

```js
const { execFile } = require('child_process');

const filePath = 'path/to/safe_script.sh';
const args = ['argument1', 'argument2'];

execFile(filePath, args, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // handle results
});
```

`child_process.spawn`: This function offers more granular control over command execution, allowing separate arguments and environment variable specification.

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const command = 'ls';
const args = ['-l', '/tmp'];

const childProcess = spawn(command, args);

childProcess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});

childProcess.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});

childProcess.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

## 2. Avoid Insecure APIs

`child_process.exec`: This function executes a shell command and is vulnerable to injection if user input is directly included in the command string. Avoid using `child_process.exec` unless absolutely necessary.

## 3. Isolate Commands from Arguments

Construct commands as separate strings from user input and arguments. This prevents malicious code injection through manipulation of spaces or special characters.

```js
// Sanitize user input
const sanitizedUserInput = sanitizeUserInput(userInput);


// Prepare user input to be escaped via command line arguments
// ❌ Insecure: Directly concatenating user input
const safeCommand = `some_command ${sanitizedUserInput}`;

// ✅ Secure: Using separate arguments
const safeCommand = child_process.execFile('some_command', [ '--someFlag', sanitizedUserInput]);
```

## 4. Avoid Shell When Possible

If possible, avoid using a shell environment when spawning child processes. This reduces the risk of shell interpretation issues.

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

spawn('ls', ['-l', '/tmp']);
```

## 5. Override Environment Variables

When spawning child processes, consider overriding environment variables to prevent leaking sensitive information from your parent process environment.

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

// Override sensitive variable
const env = { ...process.env, MY_SECRET: 'redacted' };

spawn('some_command', [], { env });
```

## Real-World Command-Injection Examples:

The provided CVEs illustrate the consequences of insecure coding practices:

- CVE-2024-21488: The network package uses child_process.exec without proper input sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands through user input.
 
- CVE-2019-25158: The tts-api package is vulnerable to command injection via the onSpeechDone function due to potentially unsafe usage of shell commands.

By adopting secure coding practices and avoiding vulnerable APIs like child_process.exec, you can significantly reduce the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in your Node.js applications.

Stay updated on best practices and consider using libraries with a strong focus on secure coding principles.
