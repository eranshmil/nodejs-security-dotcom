A few months back I gave the  [Drupal Commons 3 beta](http://drupal.org/project/commons) version a run to get a close look at an updated version of  [Acquia](http://enginx.com/blog/drupals-7-radioactivity-patch-gets-commited/acquia.com)‘s enterprise social collaboration platform.  
There’s much work to be done still but overall it feels a bit more solid than the bloated Drupal 6 based Commons stack

It’s good to remember that beta testing isn’t only about you, but also about giving back feedback on the overall product, or possibly a bug fix if you’re up for the task, so I filed this  [bug+patch](http://drupal.org/node/1816252) a while ago but it finally got  [committed](http://drupalcode.org/project/radioactivity.git/commit/aee21db).
