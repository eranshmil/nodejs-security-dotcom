Me and my friend Yakov have this habit where each morning when we go to work we make a cup of coffee and start the morning by reviewing what’s new on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/) and Freshmeat.net and basically catching up with the new development and news around the Linux and Open Source community.

Though it just hit me. In the past few months I’ve been visiting [kerneltrap](https://kerneltrap.org) and other core kernel related websites and mailing list regularly.
I guess that I’ve made the switch without even noticing.

I think I read it on either LDD (Linux Device Drivers by Kroah-Hartman) or the mailing list at one of the signatures where it said `you know you're a kernel geek once you start writing printk's typos in your user space programs` which is kind of funny once you think about it.

Anyways, have a good morning.
