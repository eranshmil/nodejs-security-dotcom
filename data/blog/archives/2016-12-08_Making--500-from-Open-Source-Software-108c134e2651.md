By all means this is not a joke, nor a spam.  
You can really, truly, make $500 dollars if you are able to just find one security vulnerability in the [qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html) project.

In all truth — this is the story of Security in Open Source Software.  
More precisely, this is the story of qmail’s security guarantee:

> In March 1997, I offered $500 to the first person to publish a verifiable security hole in the latest version of qmail: for example, a way for a user to exploit qmail to take over another account.

> My offer still stands. Nobody has found any security holes in qmail.   
> [D. J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/djb.html)

How about that for quality control in Open Source Software?

We can learn a lot about effective security guidelines from DJB, who is also the man behind the legendary DNS tool djbdns.

DJB covers 7 principles that lead him to create a secure quality software:[https://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html](https://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html) — A must read for any software engineer!
