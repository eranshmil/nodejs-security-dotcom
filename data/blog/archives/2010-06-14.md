Further improvements to the billing area include support for creating and managing **Invoices** and **Payments** for users.

On a special dev note – since FreeRADIUS doesn’t manage users as true user entities and there’s no `user_id` involved, then the payments and invoices are based on the `user_id` which is the id of the user in the `userbillinfo` table, hence it’s important to understand that every user related to billing must have an entry in `userbillinfo`.

This is ofcourse only available still in the SVN so you’ll need to check out the latest repository copy as well as fiddle a bit with the latest migration `.sql` script to import and setup the relevant database tables and access permissions.
