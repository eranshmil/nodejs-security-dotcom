A minimal daloRADIUS VM update for those of you who are still using the original VM you got from the previous daloradius.com blog website – the following commands are necessary to allow the web server user to save settings to `daloradius.conf.php` as well as add the web server user to the adm group so that it’s able to view log files by freeradius and such.

```
chown www-data:www-data /var/www/daloradius/library/daloradius.conf.php
usermod -a -G adm www-data
