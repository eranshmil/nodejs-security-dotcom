With no specific reason, or maybe with regards to the strong editing capabilities of WordPress out of the box, I wanted to opt out of  [Drupal](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/http://www.drupal.org/)  as my blogging platform for  [enginx.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/http://enginx.com/blog/migrate-drupal-7-to-wordpress-3-9-kickoff/enginx.com). Even though I’m a  [seasoned Drupal developer](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/https://drupal.org/user/1315712), even authored a book on  [Drupal 7 Media](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/http://enginx.com/blog/writing-drupal-7-media/), and  [presented](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/http://enginx.com/blog/media-drupal-7-presenting-it-drupal-camp-israel-2013/)  the topic on a local Drupal conference, I decided to migrate Drupal 7 to WordPress. Drupal is suitable for many web applications, although it does require quite an effort to maintain and setup in order to fit it to your needs, while with WordPress most of the blogging capabilities are available out of the box with almost no hassle, and for a good reason – WordPress was primarily developed as a blogging platform.

I created a Video course on  [Udemy.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/http://www.udemy.com/ "Udemy") to teach you the skills of migrating Drupal 7 to WordPress 3.9.

**The Journey**

So, off I go on my journey to locate an easy process for migrating my content from Drupal 7 to WordPress 3.9 (versions are critical) and the conclusion is quickly made apparent that while there are handful of procedures, modules and guides on converting from WordPress to Drupal, the opposite flow is quite an uncharted area. This is understandable, given that Drupal is a lot more complex in terms of content structure variety as well as having more of a framework nature than a simple blogging platform, but still, I was pretty sure I’m not the only one.

Researching the migration process it yielded a Drupal2Wordpress  [Github](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214030451/http://www.github.com/)  repository which featured a minimal, yet effective, PHP script which claims to do the job. Unlike other solutions that I found, the migration script doesn’t require an actual live instance of both sites up (the old Drupal site, and the new WordPress site), but simply requires to be configured with the database connection details for both platforms and be uploaded to the hosting account which hosts both. Without further adieu, I jumped on to the task, and as with most things open source (and unpopular or unmaintained) – things aren’t quite working out of the box and require further development effort to fine-tune and create a solid migration.

In a follow-up post I will share more details on the process of performing the actual migration to WordPress3.9, stay tuned!
