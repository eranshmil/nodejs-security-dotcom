Dedicated to everyone whom are helpless romantics as I am, and hopelessly in-love with their Node.js apps.

### In a Relationship You Respect a Spouseâ€™s Privileges!

> Roses areÂ red,

> Violets areÂ blue,

> Never run node withÂ su\_\_

If youâ€™re brain didnâ€™t auto-complete thatâ€Šâ€”â€ŠYou never want to run the Node.js process, or an npm install with a superuser privileges, **such as the common mistake**:

_\# don't do this!  
sudo node index.js_

### It Is Important ToÂ Listen

> Roses areÂ red,

> Violets areÂ blue,

> Never write a regex, or youâ€™ll DoS your taskÂ que\_\_

If youâ€™re brain didnâ€™t auto-complete thatâ€Šâ€”â€ŠYou want to avoid as much as you possible writing any custom regex code on a JavaScript app (browser or Node.js), due to the fact that regular expressions require compute cycles and it is easy to write a bad regex that can lead to denial of service by blocking the event loop.

Instead, use a common validation library such as one from below, or run your regex through safe-regex to validate the pattern.

_npm install_ [_validator_](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js/) _joi safe-regex_

### Secrets Should RemainÂ Secret

> **Committing secrets to git? Shame onÂ you!**

Plain-text secrets in your source code is bad, and worse when they get pushed to a repository, public or private. One workaround is to encrypt them at rest in source code but thatâ€™s not very manageable and has a lot of downsides, a better one is using a service over secure wire to access them. Another option is following the [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/) environment variables pattern.

Anyway, you should use a tool [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) to help ensure that you donâ€™t accidentally commit secrets like passwords and API keys or tokens to git.

_npm install_ [_git-secrets_](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) _pre-git_
