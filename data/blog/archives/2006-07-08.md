A great link I’ve found provides access to an updated list of Apple’s trailers/poster images. Useful for a php/perl script to grab it.

[http://wdirect.apple.com/trailers/home/externalA.js](http://wdirect.apple.com/trailers/home/externalA.js)

Or even better, a php: [http://www.zerohex.org/AppleTrailers.txt](http://www.zerohex.org/AppleTrailers.txt)  
Well, now that you have this file, how do you get the best out of it? Quite easy, the code is already written, on javascript though, so you’d need a console javascript engine for that. luckily Rhino which does the job is available simply by `apt-get install rhino`

Next up, you’d have to edit the file and change all the `document.write()` functions with `print()`, then add to the end of the file a function from all the provided ones like `loadRandomE();` just run it with ‘rhino -f externalA.js‘
