Starting out with something new in the area of billing and such – Invoices support.

While this is really just the start, not sure if to name it invoice, report or whatever but we’re starting out and added the PDF notifications as we’ll call them now in 2 places:

1.  Welcome notification – PDF notification emailed to the user upon creation
2.  Invoice/Report – currently implemented only for batch creations (and can be seen in the screenshot below)

We’re making use of the open source pdf library called `dompdf` which also allows easy templating of these pdf generated documents,  
whether it’s the logo, left and right placements at the top, and HTML markup to create the actual document.
