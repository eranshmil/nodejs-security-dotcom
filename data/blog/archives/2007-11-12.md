We use variables to represent unknown values in mathematical problems every day. Descartes, who lived during the 16th â€“ 17th century came up with the idea to use the lower letters of the English alphabet as variables in equations (such as `x, y, z`) and the upper letters of the alphabet as constants (`a, b, c`).
