Debian, Slackware, RedHat and Suse- What do they all got in common?  
They’re all non-celebrity distributions.

Paris Hilton is putting out her own Linux distribution, dubbed `Tinkerbel`.
You may have not known but Paris is fluent with computer programming, mainly in QT/C++ and Perl, she  
has submitted several patches on the kernel mailing list and is the author of the IPV6 Networking HOW-TO.

I give you- The Paris Linux
