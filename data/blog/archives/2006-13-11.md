Well it comes a time in one’s life when one needs to say goodbye to his favorite RJ45 LAN cable and welcome in greetings the WiFi architecture on which to get some juicy IPv4 connectivity. So first of all I had to test open networks connections, this obviously worked like a charm. WEP is also well supported out of the box (and is referenced as `restricted` networks in wifi-radar) then there’s this new method which is a really pain in the ass called WPA. That one requires some configs although in Dapper it’s really a breeze since wpa_supplicant comes already installed so there’s really just to copy the sample file from `/usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples/wpa-*.conf` to `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`, edit it a bit to set the ESSID and TKIP key and run `wpa_supplicant` from prompt to associate with the AP.

It’s all described very carefully on this great guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo
