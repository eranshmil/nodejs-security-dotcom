Recently an issue has been reported with regards to a defect in importing users into daloRADIUS with a different password type than the default `Cleartext-Password`.

The source for this problem can be [tracked back](https://sourceforge.net/p/daloradius/discussion/684102/)  to an issue that Adam opened on  [daloRADIUS’s](http://daloradius.com/)  discussion [board](https://sourceforge.net/p/daloradius/discussion/), which mainly concerns with the problem of importing users where the password type field is not the default `Cleartext-Password`. A [fix](http://sourceforge.net/p/daloradius/code/2119/)  for this has already been deployed a couple months back.[![daloRADIUS   Code   Commit  r2119](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625161313im_/http://enginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/daloRADIUS-Code-Commit-r2119-.png)](http://enginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/daloRADIUS-Code-Commit-r2119-.png)
