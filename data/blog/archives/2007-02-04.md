We sometimes find ourselves in the need to compile just one module, and not the entire set
of modules under the tree.

The Makefile that is present in the dir of the module you wish to compile should read `obj-m := module.o`
Run `make -C /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.XX-YY-ZZZ/ SUBDIRS=$PWD modules`

Compiliation should be successful and you should see the binary objects in the current dir now.
