Took care of organizing the configuration files for `freeradius` 1 and added ready-to-use config files for `freeradius` 2 as well.

Take a look into `contrib/configs/` and youâ€™ll see the `freeradius` versions categroized into directories, inside you should find a directory listing with possible configurations, since we currently have just one version of it then that should be cfg1/ and inside that the `freeradius/` or `raddb/` directories as appropriate for `freeradius` 1 and 2.
