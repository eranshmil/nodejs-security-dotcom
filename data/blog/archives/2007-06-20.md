This hectic procedure requires some tweaking and patching but most of the information and relevant files can be found at [http://cdrtool.ag-projects.com/freeradius](http://cdrtool.ag-projects.com/freeradius/)

Basically, FreeRADIUS must include the `dictionary.sip` information, be patched against the `rlm_sql` module which requires tweaking for supporting the `Acct-Status-Type` ( = 15 error message) and ofcourse the `sql.conf` must be updated with queries relevant to sip sessions (this means that the database scheme must also be altered, more accurately the `radacct` table but thatâ€™s obvious and a patch file is provided for that as well)

Goodluck.
