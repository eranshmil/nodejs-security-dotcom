It seems they no longer have an ego.  
Those engineers no longer care how to monetize or limit your use of their software.

Those engineers are philanthropists of the highest level.  
And yes, we are in an age beyond open source software.

What am I bubbling about?

Do you remember what GPL license is all about? the copyleft that makes sure certain freedoms are maintained and granted for all users of the software?

### When was the last time you saw a project with GPL-like license?

That’s right. I can’t remember either.

MIT, Apache, and BSD are very permissive software licenses which basically grant you to the right to do whatever you want with a software, as long as you maintain the copyright notice and license.

**Interesting? Here are some numbers too:**  
**Apache, BSD and MIT together form 42% of GitHub repositories**

Now I can only wonder -  
What license do you use for your open source project?
