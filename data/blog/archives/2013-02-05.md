More than often, we  [Drupal](https://web.archive.org/web/20140703084859/http://enginx.com/blog/disabling-notifications-programmatic-node-updates/drupal.org) developers find ourselves doing programmatic node modifications via the

```
node_save()
```

function. If you’re doing that as well as have  [messaging](https://web.archive.org/web/20140703084859/http://drupal.org/project/messaging) and  [notifications](https://web.archive.org/web/20140703084859/http://drupal.org/project/notifications) modules enabled in your site then given the case that your users have subscribed to content-type updates and you’re doing these ‘behind the scenes’

```
node_save()
```

stuff then you’re effectively spamming them with email updates each time you run that function.

To mitigate this issue, when saving a node programmatically you can set an attribute for the notifications module to understand that it needs not to send updates for this operation. It’s a quick and easy one:

```
function probably_your_hook(&$node) {
 // ... code ... 
 
 // Disable announcements for this operation
 $node->notifications_content_disable = 1;
 node_save($node);
 
 // ... code ... 
}
```
