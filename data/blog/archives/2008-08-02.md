Guess what? A new feature was added last week to current SVN trunk â€“ you are now able to copy&paste your vendor dictionary into a textarea input box, give the dictionary a name unless otherwise stated inside the dictionary file using the reserved keyword VENDOR and click the Apply button to add it to the database.
