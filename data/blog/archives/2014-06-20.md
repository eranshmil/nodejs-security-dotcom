The [daloRADIUS](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://www.daloradius.com/) project is celebrating it’s 7th Anniversary this month as a mature product on  [SourceForge](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/https://sourceforge.net/p/daloradius/) and one of the most leading open source project in this industry! I had a feeling I’d need to convince you so here’s the pitch with some slides and backing this up with numbers and data:

[daloRADIUS](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://www.daloradius.com/) project was founded way back in the early days of April-May 2007.

It started out as a mundane open source project which I desired to develop due to the unsupported and lack of solution in this  [Network](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center) [Operations Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center) (NOC) and overall RADIUS-based niche audience. Back then the **only** open source solution for managing a  [RADIUS](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://freeradius.org/) based deployment was `dialupadmin`, which was pretty poor in features, if to be honest, and it amazed me that no one else jumped the gun here.

And so it has began. I was out of work (then quitting a cool startup position due to no foreseeable career growth) and with nothing but time on my hands to kick off this project. One of the hardest thing I ever had to do was figure out how to name this project – one of the most annoying problems software engineers are faced with daily – naming variables, functions, classes and sometimes even their own projects.

If you’re hungry for the juicy gossip of why I ended up calling this project  [daloRADIUS](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://www.daloradius.com/), you might want to give a quick read to an interview I had with t[he FreeSoftwareMagazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/)  - [http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/interview_liran_tal_author_daloradius](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165454/http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/interview_liran_tal_author_daloradius)
