In the past year I’ve been working on a Drupal 7 Rules book as a technical reviewer, which got published recently by Packt Publishing.

“Drupal Rules How-to” is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear step-by-step exercises, which will help you take advantage of the real power of the Rules framework, and understand how to use it on a site builder and developer level.
