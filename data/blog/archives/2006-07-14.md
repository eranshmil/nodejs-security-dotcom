The usual – you download a package, installs it, it complains about a missing dependency to run. Nessus3 .deb package requires `libssl.0.9.7` but well, ubuntu is so bleeding-edge that 0.9.8 is already there, and I know exactly what you’re thinking – `apt-get remove libssl.0.9.8 && apt-get install libssl.0.9.7` – well I dare you to try that and mess up about 300 packages on the system.

So whats a better way to solve this issue? Tricking nessus:
```
ln -s /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.7
ln -s /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7
```
