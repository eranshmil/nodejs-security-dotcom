`Jabberd2` can definitely be annoying to install with all of its `pre-requiste` requirements and not having a debian package for the latest `jabberd2` (2.1.17 at this time) isn’t really adding much fun to it.

On a Debian Etch system (and possibly Ubuntu) it is required to have the following packages installed as a requirement to build `jabberd2`: 

OpenSSL support:
* libssl-dev (>= 0.9.6b)
* libssl0.9.8
* openssl

```
apt-get install libssl-dev libssl0.9.8 openssl
```

Libidn support:
* libidn11
* libidn11-dev

```
apt-get install libidn11 libidn11-dev
```
 

Expat:
* libexpat1
* libexpat1-dev
  
```
apt-get install libexpat1 libexpat1-dev
```

 
If you’re planning to work with MySQL or other database then you’d also need the header and development files, or in short:

```
apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 libmysqlclient15-dev libmysqlclient15off
```
