[Kupoya](http://www.kupoya.com/) developed a platform that leverages rapidly growing mobile devices adoption, and the wide-spread of social networks to enable digital media agencies to attract for their brands genuine and measurable social coverage across networks like [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), [Google+](http://plus.google.com/) and [LinkedIN](http://www.linkedin.com/).

With this intellectual property  [acquisition](http://en.actu-cci.com/technologies-innovations/12920-kupoya-when-social-life-means-business), Kupoya’s technology will aid [Commerce International](http://www.actu-cci.com/) in strengthening their market position with  
regards to digital media and allow them to grow a new vertical in the industry of online ad management and marketing.

### The Platform

I have founded kupoya, [partnered up with fellow colleagues](http://www.kupoya.com/aboutus/the-team/) and life-long friends to build the  [next generation](http://www.kupoya.com/why-kupoya/) marketing startup for viral adoption in the world of coupons. In kupoya I’ve been  [the technology mastermind](http://www.kupoya.com/for-business-3/)  and after building our team for the first 8 months I’ve assumed the official title of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to further lead the vision we had.
