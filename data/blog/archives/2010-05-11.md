Still in the works but you can have a peep look at something new we’re also working on – heartbeat dashboard which is familiar to some from the Mesh dashboards projects out there.

To those who aren’t familiar the idea is – a way to monitor information about a NAS (whether it’s running `OpenWRT`, `DD-WRT`, Ubiquity or other `firmware`s) without having to deploy complex monitoring systems nor without having to configure possibly complex firewall and routing rules.

It works by deploying a script on the NAS which contacts the daloRADIUS web server.

Here is how it looks, still in development:
