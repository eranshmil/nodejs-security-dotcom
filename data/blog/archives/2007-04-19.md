Ubuntu Dapper has been around for some time now and you’d figure it would have most of the important packages which are available on Debian but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Ofcourse I’m not to judge which package is more important although I would think that server-related packages like php5-pdo-sqlite should be available, but it isn’t. So one way to deal with it is contact the package author and whine all day that you want an Ubuntu version, or the other way – manually compile it.

So if you require that package on Ubuntu
(or some other distro without it):

```
apt-get install php5-dev
PHP_PDO_SHARED=1 pecl install pdo
PHP_PDO_SHARED=1 pecl install pdo_sqlite
```

And ofcourse don’t forget to update the php.ini file (at `/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini`):

```
extension=pdo.so
extension=pdo_sqlite.so
```

Goodluck.
