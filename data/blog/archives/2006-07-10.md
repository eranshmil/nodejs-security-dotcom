I got around tonight to fine-tune the MythEmail plugin I’m working on right after the great game between Italy and France for the soccer world cup title. (Zidan, what the hell were you thinking?)

Currently it’s a small and working application and more of a learning project for me to get back on the horse for QT/C++ development after a long vacation from writing code.

I’ll post the plugin as soon as it’s ready for a public release, or more like a beta :)
