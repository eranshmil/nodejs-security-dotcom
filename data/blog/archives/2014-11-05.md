_In the spirit of the computer video game  [Doom](http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Doom) and its  [skill levels](http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Skill_level), we’ll review a few ways you can improve your  [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) speed performance and optimize for better results and server response time. These tips that we’ll cover may be at times specific to Drupal 6 versions, although you can always learn the best practices from these examples and apply them on your own code base._

**Using indexes**, and  **proper SQL queries**  can boost performance by a huge factor, especially if the affected tables are very big (millions of rows). Take a look at the diff below showing a fix to a not so proper, and ill-advised use of querying the database:

The bad performing query took anything between 6 to 60 seconds to run, depending on the data, and database load, and database’s current cache state. The newer query takes milliseconds.
