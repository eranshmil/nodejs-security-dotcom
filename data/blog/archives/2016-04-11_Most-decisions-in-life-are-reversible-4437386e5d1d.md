You might be the conservative character, the shy person, or possibly the one taking less risks when it comes to making decisions all around. If that’s the case, I want to let you in on a small tip: most decisions in life are reversible. Simple as that.

Decisions shape our lives, and they drive us to action, which further shapes our reality and day to day interaction with the world.

Whether you’re making decisions concerning your personal life, or decisions at work which may affect your career, and your colleagues, you must really take in this notion that most decisions you will make in life aren’t catastrophic, aren’t one-way and that’s it.

It’s not about being courageous, but embracing the fact that you can change things, even while they’re happening, and there’s always another way.

We faced a crucial decision in my team — our technology stack was way too distributed for the size of our R&D team, and encompassed frontend HTML, JavaScript, and CSS along with backend components of PHP/[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org), Python, Pylon, and Java/Spring.

We needed to make a decision to unify our technology stack, and were curious about the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) ecosystem, and the [MEAN stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN) in general.

It was easy to stay at the comfort zone of either of PHP, Python or Java and consolidate to one of them, but if Node.js would fit us, we were not afraid to venture into new realms, even if it meant that we needed to bridge that knowledge in the team, and quickly ramp-up developers and QA with the capabilities to start working in this technology ecosystem.

We indeed ended up creating a new backend component with the [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org/) framework, which has serves us well so far, and has even attributed to improved performance.
