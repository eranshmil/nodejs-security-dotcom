The use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) is quite common among software engineers and DevOps or IT roles where they specify a string pattern to match a specific string in a text.

Often, programmers will use RegEx to validate that an input received from a user conforms to an expected condition. For example:

Testing that a userâ€™s provided e-mail address is valid:

### What does it have to do withÂ Node.js?

The risk that is inherent with the use of Regular Expressions is the computational resources that require to parse text and match a given pattern.

A flawed Regular Expression pattern can be attacked in a manner where a provided user input for text to match will require an outstanding amount of CPU cycles to process the RegEx execution.

Such an attack will render a Node.js or JavaScript application unresponsive, and thus is referred to as a ReDoSâ€Šâ€”â€ŠRegular Expression Denial of Service.

### Let me show you why RegEx is a naughty word in ourÂ office

Say youâ€™re building a music app and you want to validate song titles.

We need to match words, numbers, and spaces.  
So you give the regex a few tries and come up with the following:

Maybe itâ€™s not the perfect regex (**_hint_**: it isnâ€™t).  
But hey, it works.

I tested a few song titles and yeah, **ready to push to production, woohoo!** ðŸŽ‰

Until a Britney Spears fan plays a joke on your app and enters the following song title as input:

**Catastrophic backtracking.**  
Even if you have no clue what that is, sure sounds scary. And itâ€™s in red too!

Curious to see what it means when you have this little RegEx gem in your Node.js code?

A relatively small input string was able to block the Node.js event-loop for about 6 seconds, during which time it consumed 99% cpu power.

Not exactly what you want to do on a single-threaded web application server.

> tip: try that RegEx pattern on regex101.com and use their regex debugger to see whatâ€™s going on.

### What now?

My number one rule is avoid writing RegEx on your own, but following are the alternatives I am suggesting.

#### Use a thirdÂ party

Most of the time, if you need the common things it is better to rely on third party libraries which have a million of eyes looking at and improving both performance and security to get the job done than 3 colleagues code reviewing your version.

A recommended package for JavaScript is [**validator.js**](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js)

[**chriso/validator.js**  
_validator.js - String validation_github.com](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js "https://github.com/chriso/validator.js")[](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js)

Youâ€™ll find all the common patternsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIP Addresses, e-mails, phone numbers, etc.

> even validator.js had its own ReDoS vulnerabilities [reported](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/42) but better it, with a good community of maintainers and security researchers than rolling your own.

#### Lint your RegEx before usingÂ them

Of course you might need to end up writing your own RegEx pattern for something very unique in your use-case.

If thatâ€™s the case, consider using [safe-regex](https://github.com/substack/safe-regex) which is package to help you identify potential bad regular expressions.

_Detect possibly catastrophic, exponential-time regular expressions - davisjam/safe-regex_github.com](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex "https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex")[](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex)

**_safe-regex_** is a quick go-to but it isnâ€™t perfect actually so if youâ€™re able to integrate Jamieâ€™s tool youâ€™re better off with it:

### Further Reading

If youâ€™re interested in strengthening your skill around Node.js Security practices and avoiding Node.js pitfalls in production I invite you to [grab a copy of the book I wrote](http://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity):

[**Essential Node.js Security**  
_Hands-on and abundant with source code for a practical guide to Securing Node.js web applications.Node.js Secure Codeâ€¦_leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity "https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity")[](https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity)

Some of the topics from the book were presented live at 2017â€™s [JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) conference:

And finally, you can find a gist of security practices I helped contribute to in the popular [Node.js Best Practices GitHub repo](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices/):

Thanks for reading, and stay secure!
