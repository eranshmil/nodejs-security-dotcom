In the spirit of the computer video game [Doom](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Doom) and its [skill levels](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Skill_level), we’ll review a few ways you can improve your [Drupal](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://drupal.org/) speed performance and optimize for better results and server response time. These tips that we’ll cover may be at times specific to Drupal 6 versions, although you can always learn the best practices from these examples and apply them on your own code base.

[Drupal](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://drupal.org/) 6 shipped with all tables being  [MyISAM](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/20893/drupal-database-innodb-or-myisam), and then Drupal 7 changed all that and shipped with all of its tables using the  [InnoDB](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/20893/drupal-database-innodb-or-myisam) database engine. Each one with its own  [strengths and weaknesses](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/https://www.drupal.org/node/1553474)  but it’s quite clear that `InnoDB` will probably perform better for your Drupal site (though it has quite a bit of fine tuning configuration to be tweaked on my.cnf).

Some modules, whether on Drupal 6, or those on Drupal 7 that simply upgraded but didn’t quite review all of their code, might ship with queries like  [SELECT COUNT() which if you have migrated your tables to InnoDB (or simply using Drupal 7) then this will hinder on database performance](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211095044/http://www.percona.com/blog/2006/12/01/count-for-innodb-tables/). That’s mainly because `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` work differently, and where-as this proved as quite a fast responding query being executed on a `MyISAM` database which uses the main index to store this information, for `InnoDB` the situation is different and will result in doing a full table scan for the count. Obviously, on an `InnoDB` configuration running such queries on large tables will result in very poor performance

Note to ponder upon – what about the Views module which uses similar type of `COUNT()` queries to create the pagination for its views?
