Jabberd2 deployment.

Quick introduction – `jabber` or rather `XMPP` is a protocol or set of protocols
which define a transport layer for messages and media streams. Similar to `SIP`,
it is a sort of signaling medium on which messages can be exchanged.

`Jabberd2` is the successor of `jabberd1` and can be found at http://jabberd2.xiaoka.com/
In general, it is possible to think of the `jabberd` concept as an implementation of a
collaboration framework, much like an enhanced IRC implementation.

We will deploy it to provide Instant Messaging and Conferencing between users.

## Installation, dependencies

First off, meet the package requirements and install:
OpenSSL support
* libssl-dev (>= 0.9.6b)
* libssl0.9.8
* openssl

```
apt-get install libssl-dev libssl0.9.8 openssl
```

Libidn support
* libidn11
* libidn11-dev

```
apt-get install libidn11 libidn11-dev
```

Expat
* libexpat1
* libexpat1-dev

```
apt-get install libexpat1 libexpat1-dev
```

`roommaker.pl` script:
* libxml-simple-perl
* libdigest-sha1-perl

```
apt-get install libxml-simple-perl libdigest-sha1-perl
```

If you don’t have MySQL installed already then also:

```
apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 libmysqlclient15-dev libmysqlclient15off
```

Another important requirement is that you have resolvable domain names which will resolve
to the IP address of the `jabberd` server. If you plan on also deploying the conference plugin
to allow chat rooms then you will need 2 domain names.

We will assume through-out the document that the domain names are:
im.example.com and conf.example.com

## Installation, deployment

```
tar -xvf jabberd-2.1.17.tar.bz2
cd jabberd-2.1.17
./configure –enable-mysql –enable-ssl –enable-idn –with-extra-include-path=/usr/local/lib/:/usr/lib/ssl/ –with-extra-library-path=/usr/lib
```

If at this point you receive errors from configure it means you probably didn’t meet at least one
of the dependencies or you have it installed elsewhere, if which that is the case then tweak the include
or library configure options accordingly.
To continue:

```
make
make install

chown -R root:jabber /usr/local/etc/jabberd*
chmod -R 640 /usr/local/etc/jabberd*

mkdir -p /usr/local/var/jabberd/pid
mkdir -p /usr/local/var/jabberd/log
mkdir -p /usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/rooms
```

Then change to the /usr/local/etc directory and perform changes as following to the
configuration xml files that are present there:

```
c2s.xml:
im.example.com
register-enable='true'
pemfile='/usr/local/etc/server.pem'>im.example.com
```

- Make the tag changes in the c2s.xml file as shown above.
- To the end of the file there’s the mysql module configuration, you
can leave it as it is with the default jabberd2/secret user/pass account
or change it (but you will also have to remember to make those changes later
when we create that user in mysql)

```
sm.xml:

im.example.com

admin@im.example.com
```

`templates/roster.xml`:
(Controlling what users automatically appear on the contact list)


## Support

- Uncomment that query tag and make it look something like that.

### MySQL configuration

in the source package where the tar.gz file was extracted there’s a directory tools/
and inside it a `db-setup.mysql` file.
With the root user account run: `mysql -u root -p < db-setup.mysql`
It will create the database `jabberd2` and populate all the tables.

Then we need to allow the `jabberd2` user which is configured in all the files (c2s, sm, etc)
access to the database, inside mysql console run:

```
GRANT select,insert,delete,update ON jabberd2.* to jabberd2@localhost IDENTIFIED by 'secret';
```

Note, if you change that password from 'secret' to something else be sure to make changes
in the configuration files as well.

If everything went well you can run the jabberd program (it's actually a script
that calls the rest of the server components) as follows:

```
/usr/local/bin/jabberd
```

And now check syslog, hopefully for successful messages.

Deploying the `mu-conference` conferencing plugin is done as follows:
Get the program from: http://download.gna.org/mu-conference/

```
wget http://download.gna.org/mu-conference/mu-conference_0.7.tar.gz
tar -zxvf mu-conference_0.7.tar.gz
cd mu-conference_0.7
make

copy the mu-conference binary to /usr/local/bin
copy the muc.xml configuration file to /usr/local/etc

configure the muc.xml file as follows:

conf.example.com
conf.example.com
127.0.0.15347 
secret
/usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/rooms
/usr/local/var/jabberd/log/usr/local/var/jabberd/pid/mu-conference.pid
255

admin@im.example.com
```

- Changing the `loglevel` to 255 is a good idea when starting out, later you can change it back.

For creating persistent rooms – meaning that they always exist on the server
without having each user create them manually when he or she pleases:

in the source directory for mu-conference there’s a scripts/ directory, there you can
find the `roommaker.pl` script, run it and answer the questions as follows:

```
Please enter spool directory path (e.g. /usr/local/jabber/spool): /usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/rooms
Please enter jid for the room: lobby@conf.example.com
/usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/conf.example.com/ doesn’t exist – Create? (Y/N) y

```

What it will do is create `rooms.xml` and another `long-name.xml` file inside the
`/usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/rooms/conf.example.com/` directory, copy those files
to the actual `/usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/rooms/` folder (overwrite the `rooms.xml` it’s ok)

Then try running jabberd, after that you can run the `mu-conference` program manually
by running `/usr/local/bin/mu-conference -c /usr/local/etc/muc.xml`
And check it’s log file at: `/usr/local/var/jabberd/log/mu-conference.log`
to see that everything is ok.
