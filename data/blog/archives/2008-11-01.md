After adding customized Self Sign-up portals for PayPal as well as free, it’s time to add some support for reporting PayPal transactions happening for your Hotspot, isn’t it? :-)

Well then, here we go, we got some billing functionality added to this heavily growing platform called daloRADIUS and now you can add to your Hotspot a PayPal Self Sign-up page and track transactions made to your Hotspot easily!
