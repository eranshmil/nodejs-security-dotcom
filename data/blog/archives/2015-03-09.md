Apache Obfuscation can be achieved very easily and the benefits are great – it doesn’t disclose server information such as versions, OS, and does output verbose errors when ‘bad things happen’, and they happen.

Edit apache configuration, usually available here for RedHat based distributions: `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`

Make sure the following settings are present, save, and restart apache:

```
TraceEnable Off  
ServerSignature Off  
ServerTokens Prod
```

How do we test that this is actually working?

## How to TraceEnable

```
1. curl -v -X TRACE http://…  
2. Confirm you get a forbidden response
```

## How test ServerTokens

1. Make a request to the website and check the response headers  
2. Confirm the response contains only “Apache” information in the Server header

## How to test ServerSignature

1. Make a request to the website for a URL that should respond with Apache server error  
2. Confirm you don’t see information about the apache server software version, OS, etc.
