About 8 months ago we added a feature option to the `Management -> Users pages` to allow importing of users in the format of CSV (easy exporting from excel if you already manage it with that and a common method in general).

When importing users, you may force associating them with a `Profile` (group) and a `Plan`. Moreover itâ€™s possible to mark these users as mac-based users so an `Auth-Type := Accept` attribute is automatically added.
