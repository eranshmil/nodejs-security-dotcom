## Monitoring apache

Monitoring internal `apache` information is useful if you’re using it to serve your web application requests. It has an internal module which you can load (and probably loaded by default already) called `mod_status`. To add monitoring for apache you need to enable `mod_status` module and uncomment the `/server-status` directory.  

If you’re working with an .htaccess that overrides the vhost/normal configuration you probably also need to skip re-writing the url if the `/server-status` is request so add the following rule to the `.htaccess` file:

```
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/server-status
```

and make sure the following is in `httpd.conf`:

```
ExtendedStatus On

SetHandler server-status
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from XX.YY
Allow from 127.0.0.1
```

With munin and the bundled apache plugin for it, you get the following metrics for free:

Side-note - on some installs, like on my RHEL5, there’s a bug which will spam you with emails (if you configured those to work and being processed through a mail server). The bug is fairly described here  [https://253965.bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=177568](https://253965.bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=177568)  and to amend this you will need to apply the following patch: [http://phil.ro/patches/munin_1.3.4-r1_utf8.patch](http://phil.ro/patches/munin_1.3.4-r1_utf8.patch)
