HUD is very cool to use for monitoring users and handling a small call center but there’s no easy way to export only the extensions you want to be enabled in it. So at first I wrote a hudtool.sh script to go over sip_additional.conf and export everything to hud’s users.xml file.

The hudtool.sh was nice and useful but hardly handy since you couldn’t really filter easily the extensions you want – there comes the module for freepbx. It’s available at http://freepbx.org/trac/ticket/1660
