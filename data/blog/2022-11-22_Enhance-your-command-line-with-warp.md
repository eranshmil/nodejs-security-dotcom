Maybe you missed out on Taylor Swift's tour tickets but
don't get too sad, I want to show you some cool features
I use with [warp](https://www.warp.dev/) as my
command-line terminal tool.

It's about how we can harness AI and crowd-sourced workflows
into our day to day interactions with the command-line.

## What is Warp?

Starting off with the basics, warp is a command-line tool
that is set up to be a one-stop-shop for all your command-line
needs and is a replacement for classic terminal emulators like
iTerm, iTerm2, Hyper, etc.

## AI assisted command-line

Imagine you are working on a project in the command-line trying
to work out some tasks like for example how to figure out the
size of the current directory. You could use the `du` command
but did you know you can do that? do you know which flags you
need to use?

Warp can help you with that. It employs a form of neutral
language processing in order to understand what you are trying
to accomplish and then it will suggest the best command to
use. It will also show you the flags you need to use.

Here is a recorded video of how I use it in my own terminal
showing how I am using it to accomplish tasks such as:
1. How to find the size of the current directory
2. How to find the latest versions of the Fastify npm package
3. How to count all the files in the current directory

## Command-line Workflows

Command-line workflows with Warp are a sort of template-based
commands that were curated together to solve specific problems
that are very common in the command-line.

For example, if you don't exactly remember all the flags
and command line arguments you need to use to create an HTTP
POST request with some JSON data then you can simply browse
through an already-made template that will do that for you.

Check out Warp's workflows in the following video ⚡️

CTRL+SHIFT+`

## Command history

You probably know this command-line trick already, in which you can
type in <kbd> CTRL+R </kbd> and access the history of previous
commands thant you ran.

With Warp, you get the same thing but with a nice overlay pop-up
that makes it much easier to browse and find stuff!
