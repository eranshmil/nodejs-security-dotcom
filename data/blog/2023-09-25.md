In the ever-evolving landscape of Node.js development, where innovation keeps the runtime growing with new APIs and speed of new npm packages added to the npm registry, code review skills are paramount and can make the difference from a command injection vulnerability being exploited or not.

One crucial aspect should take center stage in code reviews: security. I'm sure you genuinely care about the quality traits of your application's code, but vulnerabilities can lurk beneath the surface, hiding in insecure coding practices, that you understandably not having the time to keep up with.

In this article, I am hoping to equip you, the Node.js developer, with practical tips for conducting code reviews that specifically target command injection vulnerabilities.

## The Secure Code Review Imperative

Code review, the process of scrutinizing and evaluating code to ensure its quality and security, emerges as a formidable shield against such threats. In the realm of Node.js development, where agility is celebrated, code review plays a pivotal role in balancing the need for rapid innovation with the imperative for robust security.

Keeping up with pull request code reviews is difficult enough, but when you add the need to be on the lookout for security vulnerabilities, it can be overwhelming. I may have some good news on that though, stay tuned.

In the time being, it's vital to recognize code review is essential in identifying security issues early in the development process. It provides an opportunity for peers to evaluate code quality, security, and adherence to Node.js secure coding best practices before the code lands in production.

> First time you hear about command injection vulnerabilities? Command injection vulnerabilities, a subset of security risks, pose a significant danger to Node.js applications. They allow malicious actors to inject arbitrary commands into your code, potentially gaining unauthorized access, compromising sensitive data, or executing malicious actions on your server.

In a Code Review process you probably seek to achieve the following fundamental objectives:

- Uncover vulnerabilities, including command injection, before they reach production.
- Improve code quality, maintainability, and overall reliability.
- Ensure adherence to security standards (e.g: cryptographic APIs when handling user passwords) and security best practices.
- A secure code review process fosters knowledge sharing and skill development.
- Diverse perspectives lead to more comprehensive security assessments.
- Encourages open communication within development teams, promoting a culture of continuous improvement.

## Identifying Vulnerable Code Patterns

In this pivotal chapter, we'll dissect common code patterns that can inadvertently introduce command injection vulnerabilities into your Node.js applications. By dissecting these patterns, you'll gain valuable insights into recognizing and mitigating such risks during code review.

In each example, we'll provide practical insights into why these patterns are risky and how you can identify and remediate them during your Node.js code review process.

### 1. String Concatenation in Commands (e.g: Node.js `exec`)

Code Pattern:

```js
const userInput = req.query.input;
const command = `echo ${userInput}`;
exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // Handle the command execution
});
```

**Why It's Risky**: Using string concatenation directly in commands can allow malicious input to inject additional commands, compromising security.

### 2. Insufficient Input Validation in Node.js code

Code Pattern:

```js
const filename = req.body.filename;
exec(`cat ${filename}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // Handle the command execution
});
```

**Why It's Risky**: Failing to validate user input can permit attackers to manipulate input, executing unauthorized commands.

### 3. Lack of Proper Escaping in Node.js code

Code Pattern:

```js
const userInput = req.query.input;
exec(`echo "${userInput}"`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // Handle the command execution
});
```

**Why It's Risky**: Inadequate escaping can allow an attacker to break out of the intended context and inject malicious commands.

I should note also here that this way to escape dangerous characters in a command or shell context is generally not advised and isn't the proper secure code best practice to take.

If you do need to escape user input, at the very least you should use a library that provides a secure way to escape dangerous characters in a command or shell context. For example, the [shell-quote](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/shell-quote) library provides a secure way to escape dangerous characters in a command or shell context.

### 4. Insecure Reliance on Command Line Arguments in Node.js exec function

Code Pattern:

```js
const userRole = getUserRoleFromDatabase();
exec(`grantPermission --role=${userRole}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // Handle the command execution
});
```

**Why It's Risky**: Using command line arguments without validation can allow attackers to inject additional commands, compromising security. This pattern is often overlooked, but it can be just as dangerous as the other patterns we've discussed.

## Best Practices for Secure Code Review of Node.js code

Secure code review is paramount for Node.js and JavaScript developers to ensure code quality and security. Here are suggestions for practices ideal that will help enhance your code review process and foster a culture of secure coding:

### 1. Node.js API Documentation

Consult the official Node.js API documentation regularly. Familiarity with the documentation ensures you're using Node.js APIs correctly and securely.
Leverage the documentation's code examples to understand how to implement features securely.

One example where this is paramount is when you work with cryptographic operations. The Node.js [crypto module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.

Reading the Node.js API carefully to understand how to leverage the crypto module to implement cryptographic operations securely is key to avoid security issues.

###  2. Utilize Secure APIs

Always opt for secure versions of Node.js APIs when available. For instance, prefer the crypto module for cryptographic operations rather than attempting custom implementations.

One example where this is paramount is the [Node.js `exec` function](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) which is used to execute commands in a shell and buffer the output. The `exec` function is a common source of command injection vulnerabilities in Node.js applications.

### 3. Dependency Scanning

Integrate dependency scanning tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io) or the [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor) into your code review process where it is relevant to review newly added or updated dependencies.

Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies and address them promptly.

### 4. Code Security Linting

Enforce code linting rules specific to Node.js and JavaScript using tools like ESLint. Customize ESLint rules to include security-focused guidelines, ensuring your codebase adheres to best practices.

If you choose ESLint, then you have the `eslint-plugin-security` plugin which provides ESLint rules for Node.js security.

However, ESLint and the `eslint-plugin-security` is very rigid and doesn't provide much flexibility. You may end up with a lot of false positives and it's not very easy to customize the rules.

I'm biased but I'd recommend you take a look at [Snyk Code](https://snyk.io/product/code/) which provides you with secure code linting in real-time on your VS Code IDE. It's free too.

### 5. Data Validation and Sanitization

Emphasize the importance of input validation and data sanitization in code reviews. Ensure that user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection.
Encourage the use of established libraries for input validation and sanitization, such as the validator library for JavaScript.

### 6. Staying up to date with Node.js releases

Stay updated with the Node.js release notes to identify security enhancements and new features.

### 7. Error Handling

Review error handling practices to prevent information leakage. Avoid exposing detailed error messages to users. Encourage the use of custom error handling middleware to centralize error management and enhance security.

Another important tip here is to take notice you don't leak data from `process.env` as that is a very common source of information leakage.

### 8. Secure Package Management

Educate developers about secure package management practices. Ensure they only install trusted packages from reliable sources.

Implement lockfile linters such as [lockfile-lint](https://github.com/lirantal/lockfile-lint) to ensure that dependencies specified in the lockfile adhere to pre-defined security policies and mitigate a vector of attack where malicious actors can tamper with the lockfile.

### 9. Threat Modeling

Introduce threat modeling during code review discussions. Encourage developers to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their code.
Consider using threat modeling tools or frameworks tailored for Node.js security assessments.

### 10. Continuous Education

Emphasize continuous education within your development team. Encourage developers to stay updated on security best practices through training, workshops, and online resources.

Promote participation in Node.js and JavaScript security communities to learn from peers and experts.

Two resources I'd recommend you check out are:
1. The [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io/) educational platform which is open and free for everyone to learn about security.
2. My book  [Node.js Secure Coding: Defending Against Command Injection Vulnerabilities](https://www.nodejs-security.com) which is a practical guide to understanding, identifying, and mitigating command injection vulnerabilities in Node.js applications.
